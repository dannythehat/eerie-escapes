This tiny island in the Venetian Lagoon holds one of history's darkest secrets: it served as a quarantine station for plague victims in the 1700s, where over 160,000 people died in agony. Later, it housed a mental asylum where a deranged doctor allegedly performed lobotomies and tortured patients before throwing himself from the bell tower. The island has been abandoned since 1968, and locals refuse to go near it, believing it's cursed. This exclusive expedition—limited to just 8 brave souls—grants you illegal access (with special permits) to investigate the crumbling hospital, asylum, and plague pits. Armed with EMF detectors, spirit boxes, and thermal cameras, you'll conduct a full night investigation in one of the most paranormally active locations on Earth. Documented phenomena include shadow figures, disembodied screams, and the phantom ringing of the bell tower's bell—which was removed decades ago. This is extreme paranormal investigation for serious ghost hunters only.",
